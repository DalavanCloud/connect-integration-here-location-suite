## Amazon Connect integration -- HERE Location Suite
 
This Quick Start integrates HERE Location Suite with Amazon Connect to provide location intelligence in Amazon Connect. The integration includes a set of AWS Lambda functions that Amazon Connect uses to interact with HERE Location Suite REST APIs.

HERE Location Suite provides access to mapping, geocoding, places, routing, traffic, transit, positioning, and geovisualization functionality and out-of-the-box solutions to solve complex location problems such as geofencing, calculating the toll costs for a route, and customizing a route.
